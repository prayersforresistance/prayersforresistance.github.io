          <p>H' and others who hold me accountable, please help me with this critical mind. Help me to feel through my whole body how high the stakes are and to keep my humility, my patience, my compassion, my space for You. H please help me to know when my anger is righteous and when it is self-righteous. Help me to keep my finger on the throbbing pulse of pain in this world that gets wider and deeper and more frightened every day and also keep my heart open to those who are further from that pulse today because they are Yours, too. Help me know I am always that person in some way. Caitlin Elly Breedlove taught us this summer that I am still here in this movement because someone was patient with me, and I know that, H. Help me to remember that. Help me to stay connected and soft so I can move with greater agility, power, and wisdom. Help me remember how little I know, how wrong I've been, how hard we are all trying. H help me find that gentle fierce place in the middle between the vastness of what is needed and Your creations before me who I must believe are enough for what we need. the Rev Dr MLK wrote we must keep our minds sharp and our hearts soft, and H, you and I know where my test is on that scale. Please H let the toughness I have built for my and our safety find a new use. Let it gird me to feel that pulse and love Your Creations with a strength I haven't met yet. I have what I have so I can do this work and need You to help me keep doing it better. Thank You, thank you. </p>
