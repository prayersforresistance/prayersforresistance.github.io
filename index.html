          <p>H' and others who hold me accountable, please help me with this critical mind. Help me to feel through my whole body how high the stakes are and to keep my humility, my patience, my compassion, my space for You. H please help me to know when my anger is righteous and when it is self-righteous. Help me to keep my finger on the throbbing pulse of pain in this world that gets wider and deeper and more frightened every day and also keep my heart open to those who are further from that pulse today because they are Yours, too. Help me know I am always that person in some way. Caitlin Elly Breedlove taught us this summer that I am still here in this movement because someone was patient with me, and I know that, H. Help me to remember that.Help me to stay connected and soft so I can move with greater agility, power, and wisdom. Help me remember how little I know, how wrong I've been, how hard we are all trying. H help me find that gentle fierce place in the middle between the vastness of what is needed and Your creations before me who I must believe are enough for what we need. the Rev Dr MLK wrote we must keep our minds sharp and our hearts soft, and H, you and I know where my test is on that scale. Please H let the toughness I have built for my and our safety find a new use. Let it gird me to feel that pulse and love Your Creations with a strength I haven't met yet. I have what I have so I can do this work and need You to help me keep doing it better. Thank You, thank you</p>

          <p>calling in the Divine, the One of many names, the One that is within each of us and is a thread of commonality. the One singing queer love on the highest mountain, the One dancing in moments of grief, of joy, of sorrow. we thank you, Divine One, for this life we live. we ask of you, Divine One, here and now, for your kindest embrace in this sacred moment in time on this Earth plane. we are witnessing brokenness and separation, and ask for your guidance. we ask for attunement in our Revolutionary Hearts; may our Revolutionary Hearts know your untethered, beauty-way, so we may serve our selves and our communities authentically, vulnerably, and with integrity coalescing. may we gather in your ever-present, inspiring arms and with your grace. may we sing our sorrow songs; arriving and rising up together from the ashes of this moment. may this moment in time be graced by the power of Transformation; may this fracture in humanity crack open into the Light we know is possible. may we come together and never apart. may we know and embrace your truth of no separation. may we listen; gently and compassionately. may we hug each other more, pray more, pause more, play more, seek to understand more. may we bridge the gap between you, Divine One, and us, so that we can act from the Divine, unconditional Love place, and may that place of love in which you rest, ripple out into all Beings, near and far, so we can sing that same, fierce, authentic and vulnerable heart-song together. may this crack within me and within the fabric of this current reality lean into your well-tended temple; let us experience you deeper and wider, to understand these cracks, so we may tend them with you. we sing your praise, we sing your pain, we sing your Creations, from now until the end of time. amin, amen, athem.</p>

          <p>Divine Powers that Be, we don't ask the work be done for us. Only that you help us to do it ourselves. Grant us 1460 days worth of stamina. Suffuse us with the fire to sacrifice. Steel us to give beyond what we thought possible to give. Spur us to trade easy patriotism for hard work, and keep us unflaggingly woke. We're determined; we're ready. And, we need your help. Please also grant us a few audaciously next level dance parties. To raise our spirits high.</p>

          <p>To all of Your good names,<br>
our hearts scream:<br>
Keeper of Faith<br>
Guarantor of Justice<br>
Master of Sustenance<br>
Liberator, Illuminator,<br>
Lofty Lifter, Lover of <br>
Left, Right, Between and Beyond,<br>
protect your wondering servants,<br>
embolden the spirit of possibility,<br>
make heard the whispers of wisdom,<br>
reveal paths of collaboration,<br>
give light to the righteous,<br>
place a stumbling block <br>
before, to the side, and behind <br>
the feet of those who seek to blind.<br>
Grower of Mysteries,<br>
plant for us the keys.<br>
Breaker of Spells,<br>
wake us from this sleep.<br>
Dweller in Voids,<br>
open the doors of our homes.<br>
Revealer in Clouds,<br>
remove from us this shroud.<br>
Hear our tears<br>
and see our songs.<br>
Though our time tumbles,<br>
let this moment crawl.<br>
For our bones will crumble<br>
and our dreams will drown.<br>
As surely as we will end, <br>
You only always begin.<br>
Until when? Until then?<br>
When is now. Now is then.<br>
Again and again.<br>
Amen and amen.</p>
